# Amogus File Encoding

Encode and decode your files and strings in a sussy way!

## Explanation

For each byte inside a file the program gets 8 bits and creates strings for them. It then adds a random color before the SUS(1) or SAFE(0) to make everything amogus.
Each bit is separated by ; for better readability :)

The encoding is easily recoverable in case of 1/2 character failure as each bit takes around 9 bytes of space!
